An example of cross service telemetry in Rust using OpenTelemetry.


### Tracing

The **tracing** crate is used to instrument the application code. 

Demonstrates propagation of trace context across `reqwest` calls,
a generated progenitor client and kafka messages.

In the case of kafka we create a linked span rather than continuing the parent span. 

The `tracing-opentelemetry` crate is subscribes to `tracing` and exports the traces 
to the **OpenTelemetry Collector** using `opentelemetry-otlp`.

**Span metrics** are calculated from the trace data using the otel collector along with exemplars.

Visualized natively in Grafana:

### Logs

Log events are both shown on the console and exported to the **OpenTelemetry Collector** using
the `OpenTelemetryTracingBridge` - these can be viewed in Loki.

### Metrics

In application metrics are implemented via opentelemetry meter including for http requests
via a fork of `axum-otel-metrics`. The otel collector also collects metrics from postgresql and 
kafka exporting them all to Prometheus.
